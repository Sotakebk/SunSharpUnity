# SunSharp Unity
This is a redistribution of [SunSharp](https://github.com/Sotakebk/SunSharp) for Unity, with additional code and helpers.

It appears that it should work, but builds were not yet tested. You can message me in case of problems!

Target SunVox Library version: 2.1.0.
## How to install
In the Package Manager, press the big '+' button in the top-left corner, then click on 'Add package from git URL'. After filling out the field with this repository's URL, the package should be available to use.
## How to use
See the [example here](https://github.com/Sotakebk/SunSharpUnity_VRDemo). The code is about the same as with the NuGet packages.
